* [FauxPilot-WebClient](https://github.com/fauxpilot-addon/fauxpilot-webclient): We can easily and conveniently test the reasoning results running on the Fauxpilot server using the REST API and web programming language. In this case, the user only needs a web browser. Colleagues can also participate in the test immediately and receive feedback only with a web browser. Therefore, the web-based FauxPilot client aims to make it more convenient and immediately read by users and developers of the FauxPilot project.



* [Visual Studio Code - Fauxpilot Client](https://github.com/Venthe/vscode-fauxpilot)
The original source code has been mirrored from the VSC extension guidelines. Please be careful! This extension requires the Fauxpilot server by @moyix to work.
